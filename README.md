## Leap Year 

Leap year usually occurs every 4 years (divisible by 4) BUT, if leap year is on a century (divisible by 100), then that century must be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year. 

__Hint:__ Notice 400 and 100 are both divisible by 4

*For example: *

```
Please enter a year: 2021
2021 is not a leap year

Please enter a year: 2020
2020 is a leap year
```

In the `main.py`, write a program to determine this. Make sure to output the answer in the same format as the example.
